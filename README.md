🔍 PROJECT CONTEXT SUMMARY – LEADER FREIGHT ANALYSIS (PERNIX x LEADER SYSTEMS)
🗓 Timeline & Communication Summary (October 2025)

1️⃣ 1 Oct 2025 — Kickoff Email (Matthew Fitzpatrick → Leader Systems)

Pernix and Leader agreed to collaborate on analysing freight data for optimisation, spend visibility, and performance analysis.

The key datasets Leader can provide were defined as:

Core data: invoices, contracts, catalogues, suppliers

Operations data: transport details, costs, performance metrics

Nice to have: geospatial data, market rates, benchmarks

Goal: Understand freight costs and performance, find optimisation or cost-saving opportunities.

Outputs expected:

Spend by carrier, route, mode

Cost per kg per route

Supplier performance (DIFOT = Delivery In Full On Time)

Price benchmarking and optimisation recommendations

2️⃣ 8 Oct 2025 — Leader confirms participation

Jiajing Ju (SA Accountant) at Leader says she’ll upload invoice data.

She also loops in Axel Henderson for contracts and catalogue data.

Pernix creates an External Teams site for shared data access.

3️⃣ 13 Oct 2025 — Data uploaded

Jiajing uploads StarTrack invoices (main freight supplier).

Matthew (Pernix) acknowledges receipt and says they’ll start reviewing.

4️⃣ 22 Oct 2025 — Pernix requests clarification

Matt Fitzpatrick emails Leader Systems (Jiajing + Chris + Axel) with questions while the data is being loaded into Spend Analytix (Pernix’s analytics platform).

His two key questions:

Meaning of weight/volume columns in StarTrack invoice spreadsheets.

Columns: Items Connote, Dead Weight, Cube, Charge Weight

Matt’s assumptions:

Items Connote = number of consignments

Dead Weight = actual total kg

Cube = total volume

Charge Weight = billable (whichever is greater of actual vs cubic weight)

He asks if these are correct and who calculates them (Leader or StarTrack).

Delivery times: can Leader supply actual arrival dates or delivery data to calculate DIFOT (Delivery In Full On Time)?

5️⃣ 22 Oct 2025 — Axel replies to Matt

Axel explains:

Weight and cube data come from Leader’s dataset, which is then re-cubed by StarTrack’s automated belt systems.

Leader has its own dataset to cross-check against expected pricing via their API.

Delivery time data isn’t in the billing dataset, but he can access it through reports or dashboard portals.

All Leader freight is express service only (so consistent delivery windows).

He offers to get DIFOT data from reports or directly from the account manager.

6️⃣ 23 Oct 2025 — Matt follows up again

Matt thanks Axel for the info and asks:

Can we access “arrival date” to compare against “proposed delivery time”?

How should the DIFOT report be structured — e.g. by overall summary, by branch, or by state?

7️⃣ 23 Oct 2025 — Axel replies again

Axel says he can request a DIFOT report and asks how Matt wants it structured (overall, state-based, etc).

As of the latest message you pasted, Matt has NOT replied yet to Axel’s last question.

✅ So the current open thread:

Axel is waiting for Matt (Pernix) to confirm how he’d like the DIFOT report presented — e.g. overall vs branch-level.

📦 Summary of Data So Far

Leader Systems has shared StarTrack invoice datasets (Excel spreadsheets) named like:

Electronic Invoice Reporting - Debtor - 10129651-2025-10-02-05-15-41.xlsx

These files contain key freight metrics:

Column Name	Meaning (per Axel)	Notes
Z Items Connote	Number of items/cartons per consignment	Count of packages
AA – Dead Weight	Actual weight in kilograms	From scales
AB – Cube Weight	Volume converted to “cubic weight”	Road = 250; FPP = 190; bulk = 250 or 333
AC – Charge Weight	The chargeable weight (whichever is higher: dead or cube)	Determines cost
Arrival Date	(Missing) — needed to calculate DIFOT	Will come from a different report/dashboard
🎯 The Current Goal

Pernix (you, Matt, Param, Murtaza, and Aaron) are:

Loading and analysing the invoice datasets in Spend Analytix

Trying to build a freight cost model that compares expected vs actual pricing, plus delivery performance (DIFOT).

To complete the analysis, you need:

Arrival/delivery date dataset (for transit time comparison)

DIFOT report (from Leader, as Axel can supply)

Possibly contract rate tables (to validate billing)

🧩 Where You Come In (Joey)

You’ve been looped in (cc’d) to support the technical data side — mainly:

Helping ingest or validate spreadsheets into Spend Analytix

Understanding data structure and mapping

Helping communicate back with Matt, Param, and Leader when data inconsistencies or missing fields arise

⚙️ Recommended Next Steps for You
✅ Step 1 — Clarify Missing Response

Check if Matt has responded to Axel’s DIFOT report question (latest message 23 Oct).
If not, you could remind or suggest a structure yourself — e.g.:

“Axel, thanks — a state-based DIFOT summary, broken down by branch and service type, would be perfect. Also, if available, please include dispatch vs arrival date per consignment for deeper analysis.”

That keeps the ball moving.

✅ Step 2 — Gather the Right Spreadsheets for Me (ChatGPT) to Review

To help you accurately:
Please upload or share these (remove any private info first):

📊 StarTrack invoice Excel file(s)
e.g. Electronic Invoice Reporting - Debtor - 10129651-2025-10-02-05-15-41.xlsx
→ I can explain structure, map fields, and show how to load into Spend Analytix or Power BI.

📋 Contracts or rate card files (if available)
→ Needed to check charge weight pricing logic.

📈 DIFOT or arrival data file (once Axel sends it)
→ I can help you merge this with invoice data to calculate on-time performance.

Once you share these, I can show:

Exactly how each column should map into Spend Analytix

How to join datasets to get delivery time insights

How to structure a report or dashboard summary for Matt

🧠 In Plain English: What’s Actually Going On

Pernix is doing a freight cost and performance analysis for Leader Systems, using their StarTrack freight data.
Matt is leading the analytics, and you’re on the support/tech side.
Leader’s side (Axel + Jiajing) are providing the data and clarifying what each column means.
Right now, Pernix is missing the arrival/delivery data, which blocks the DIFOT (delivery performance) part of the analysis.
Axel has offered to get this, but Matt hasn’t yet told him how he wants the report structured — so the project is paused at that step.

Once you have that report, you can:

Compare planned vs actual delivery times

See performance per branch/state

Correlate cost vs performance → identify inefficiencies or high-cost routes

🧾 TL;DR Executive Summary
Item	Description
Client	Leader Systems
Consultant	Pernix (Matt Fitzpatrick + team)
Project	Freight spend and performance analytics
Data	StarTrack invoice spreadsheets
Current Blocker	Missing delivery/arrival data for DIFOT analysis
Next Step	Confirm report structure with Axel + ingest new data
Your Role (Joey)	Assist in data mapping, validation, and analysis setup in Spend Analytix
Key Contacts	Matt Fitzpatrick, Paramveer Singh, Murtaza Bootwala, Aaron Reynolds, Graham Rock (Pernix); Axel Henderson, Jiajing Ju, Chris Pittman (Leader Systems)

Perfect Joey — this is exactly what I needed to see. You’ve got the full StarTrack dataset (invoice + rate schedules + contract terms), so we can now create a clear “context doc” that explains:

What the brief is

What the problem is

What Pernix (you) are doing

What Leader Computers expects as the outcome

What data you already have

What you still need

And how to actually do the work (step by step, in layman’s terms)

📘 Full Context Summary: Leader Freight / StarTrack Freight Analysis
1. The Brief (High Level)

Leader Computers uses StarTrack for freight (Road Express + Fixed Price Premium).
They want to know:

Are they being billed correctly according to their rate agreement?

Are they getting good value vs their contract and what other carriers charge?

Can Spend Analytix (Pernix) help show savings, inefficiencies, or errors in freight billing?

So this project = a freight spend validation & benchmarking exercise.

2. The Problem (In Plain English)

Leader has thousands of shipments each month. StarTrack sends invoices with line-by-line charges (like what you pasted).
But it’s unclear if:

Each shipment’s cost matches the contract rate (base + per kg + surcharges).

They are being charged for extras (manual handling, oversize, futile deliveries, etc.) correctly.

The discounts or minimum spends in the contract are being applied properly.

Essentially — they want proof that StarTrack is charging fairly and that Leader isn’t overpaying.

3. What Pernix / You Are Doing

Pernix (your company) is using Spend Analytix (your analytics platform) to:

Clean and structure StarTrack invoice data

Compare each consignment (connote) to the official contract rate tables

Spot anomalies or overcharges

Produce insights and visuals (Power BI or Excel) showing:

Average cost per shipment

Variance from contract

Which lanes (e.g., MEL → WA) cost more than expected

Savings opportunities or negotiation leverage for Leader

So your role is to prepare, clean, and match data → analyze → summarize findings clearly for the client.

4. The Goal (Big Picture Outcome)

✅ Output to Leader:

A clear report or dashboard showing:

Correctness of charges

Breakdown of fuel & surcharges

Where rates don’t align

Potential savings or errors

Confidence that Pernix is adding value by auditing and optimizing their freight spend.

5. Data You Already Have

From what you pasted, you’ve got all key sources:

a. StarTrack Invoice CSV / Excel Export

Each row = one consignment with:

Connote number

From/To zones

Service type (EXP / FPP)

Weights

Total charge

Fuel, security, GST
✅ This is your “actuals” dataset.

b. StarTrack Rate Schedule

Shows the contracted rates Leader should pay:

Base charge per consignment

Per-kg rates by zone (e.g. MEL → AC1 = $17.07 base + $1.827/kg)

Additional charges (oversize, manual handling, futile, etc.)
✅ This is your “expected” dataset.

c. Contract & Terms

Shows:

Minimum monthly spend ($412,700)

Annual price review (APR) rules

Surcharge policies (fuel %, security 4.35%)
✅ This gives business context & validation rules.

6. What You Still Need to Confirm

Ask Param or Matt (Pernix team):

Which service type Leader wants benchmarked — Road Express, Fixed Price Premium, or both?

Which benchmark to use — the Leader contract rate table or a StarTrack standard rate sheet (if comparing to retail pricing)?

Do they have freight from other carriers (TNT, Allied, CouriersPlease, etc.) to compare against StarTrack?

These details help define whether you’re doing:

A contract compliance check, or

A market rate comparison.

7. How You’ll Do the Work (Step-by-Step)

Here’s your layman’s guide to preparing for the meeting and analysis:

Step 1. Understand the fields

Each invoice record has:

Connote → shipment tracking ID

From Zone / To Zone → region codes (e.g. MEL = Melbourne, ABY = Albany)

Service Type → Road Express (EXP), Fixed Price Premium (FPP), etc.

Charge Weight → what the billing is based on (dead or cubic)

Cost, Fuel, GST → total invoice cost components

Step 2. Match rates

You’ll check:

Does the total charge = Base charge + (Charge weight × rate per kg) + surcharges?

So, for MEL → ABY (Road Express):

Base = $11.22

Rate per kg = $0.524
If the shipment weighs 9 kg → expected = $11.22 + (9 × 0.524) = $15.94 (+ fuel + security).
Compare that to the invoice $20.10 — see if it matches or not.

Step 3. Account for surcharges

Fuel (from invoice) = $2.56
Security = 4.35% of base freight cost
Manual handling, oversize, etc., may also apply.
Check rate sheet for applicable extras.

Step 4. Flag mismatches

If expected ≠ actual by more than ~5%, highlight it.
E.g. “MEL → ALBANY shows 20% higher than expected contract rate.”

Step 5. Summarize insights

Make a short note or dashboard like:

Lane	Avg Variance	Likely Cause	Comment
MEL → ABY	+15%	Manual Handling Fee	Possibly oversized cartons
MEL → AC1	-3%	Normal	Matches rate table

This becomes the “value” Pernix shows Leader: data-driven cost clarity.

8. How You’ll Present Value Back to Leader

You’ll be showing them:

“Here’s where StarTrack billing doesn’t match your contract.”

“Here’s where you might be paying more than expected.”

“Here’s what your monthly freight cost breakdown looks like.”

“If you switched lanes or carriers, you could save X%.”

That’s the Spend Analytix story — clear visibility of spend → insight → savings → trust in Pernix.

9. Tools You’ll Use

Excel or Power BI — to join invoice data with rate table, run formulas, and build visuals.

ChatGPT (me) — to help write formulas, summaries, and dashboard notes.

Email or Teams — to get clarifications from Param, Matt, or Leader.

10. Immediate Actions for You (Before Meeting)

✅ Message Param:

“Hey Param, I’ve got access to the StarTrack invoice data and the Leader rate schedule. Just confirming — do we want to benchmark using Road Express, Fixed Price Premium, or both? Also, do you have any TNT or other carrier data for cross-comparison?”

✅ Review your invoice CSV — make sure it has:

Connote

From/To zones

Weight

Cost components
If not, ask for the missing columns.

✅ Have the rate schedule Excel ready (the one you pasted in text form) — we can help you make a “rate lookup” formula in Excel to auto-calculate expected costs.

✅ Prepare to show Leader:

3 sample consignment comparisons

A short list of early insights or anomalies

(Optional) A Power BI or Excel chart summarizing freight spend by zone.

11. Optional: Missing Responses

You asked: “Has Matt replied to Axel’s message about the DIFOT report?”
→ I can’t access live inboxes, but from your previous notes, it looks like Matt hasn’t replied yet. You might want to follow up gently to check if the DIFOT (Delivery In Full, On Time) report is still required this week.

12. What You Can Upload to Me (for deeper help)

Upload any of these:

Invoice CSV/Excel (even one week’s worth)

Rate schedule Excel (StarTrack contract)

Any “rate comparison” sheet Param or Matt already started

Any other carrier rate sheet

Once you upload them, I can:

Help you create formulas to match rates

Build a summary pivot or Power BI layout

Prepare slides or meeting notes for Leader
